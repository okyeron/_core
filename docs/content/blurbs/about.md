# About 

The zeptocore is an *[open-source](https://github.com/schollz/_core)* handheld device for playing with samples, featuring:

- stereo playback of 16-bit audio files @ 44.1 kHz sampling rate
- sd-card storage for up to 8 gigabytes of samples
- recall up to 256 audio files (16 banks of 16 tracks)
- includes 16 different 32-bit effects (saturate, fuzz, delay, reverb, etc...)
- single-cycle wavetable synthesizer
- realtime sequencer with optional quantization

### goals

1. *open-source* matters. you should be able to change this device today or years from now.
2. learning is not curved, though learning is rewarded. the device should be fun without reading a manual, but reading the manual only adds to the fun.
3. time is yours. by default, the device should not enforce "quantization" and leave it to the user to make their own timings.

### non-goals

a non-goal for this project is to be emulate a specific musical device. 

a non-goal for this project is audio synthesis. though I may change my mind about this.
