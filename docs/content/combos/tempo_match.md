Tempo matching is where the speed of the playback of a sample is multiplied in order to match the ratio between the BPM of the sample (set in the [tool](https://tool.zeptocore.com)) and the BPM of the current tempo in the zeptocore. Normally this is set per-sample when loading samples on the zeptocore, but it can also be set on the fly.

Tempo match mode will display `MATCH ON` if enabled and will display `MATCH OFF` when disabled.
