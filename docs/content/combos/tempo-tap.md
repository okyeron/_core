The Tempo feature offers dual methods for precision tempo control. 

First, you can adjust dynamically by holding **A** and rotating **Knob X**â€”with mid-knob representing original BPM, full clockwise for double speed, and full counter-clockwise for half speed. 

Second, you can hold **A** and tap **B** to tap in the tempo, ranging from 30 to 300 BPM. 

In both methods, the newly set tempo is momentarily displayed, allowing for immediate visual confirmation of adjustments, ensuring users can effortlessly sync their audio to the desired pace.
