If you bought the zeptocore from me, I tried to provide the best SD card I could find.

Not all SD cards are the same. Even if a card says "high-speed" or "A1" or "U3" or something, it doesn't nessecarily mean its fast.

Here is a list of known good and bad cards:

### Known bad cards

Do *not* use these cards! They may appear to work, but they can cause spurious glitches.

- Lexar brand
- Kootion brand
- Sandisk Ultra
- Kingston brand

### Known good cards

- Juanwe
- SanDisk Ultra, SanDisk Extreme
- SP Elite
- Samsung EVO
- PNY Elite
- MicroCenter
- Gigastone

Here's my own investigation into the cards and my comparison of what I had available. The cards on the very left have random dropouts and the cards on the very right are too slow. The cards in the midle are best:
