I'm sorry about this. This is most likely due to SD cards. Not all SD cards are the same - some have huge latencies that can "spike" which cause audio drops. See [the answer of this question](#which-sd-card-can-i-use) to learn which SD card is the best to use. When you do hear a glitch, the zeptocore often can recover from this (though producing bad/good glitch sounds) but in rare occasions a restart may be needed. The provided SD card should be suitable, but if it is not please let me know.
