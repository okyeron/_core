# Modes

There are three modes that can be activated within the zeptocore:

*Jump Mode* is the default mode you get when turning on the zeptocore and is also activated by pressing **A** + **B**. In this mode, the **1-16** keys allow users to navigate through audio slices, create loops, or retrigger audio samples for dynamic performance effects. 

*Mash Mode*, accessed by pressing **A** + **C**, transforms the **1-16** keys into toggles for activating or deactivating effects. This mode is perfect for creating additional complexity and textures in a sample.

*Bass Mode*, initiated with **A** + **D**, assigns bass notes to the **1-16** keys, enabling users to play melodic basslines directly from the device. This mode makes it easy to integrate speaker-shaking audio elements to the output.
