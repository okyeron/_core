I'm sorry about this. This is most likely due to SD cards. Not all SD cards are the same. Some have huge latencies that can "spike" which cause audio drops. The zeptocore often can recover from this (though producing bad/good glitch sounds) but in rare occasions a restart may be needed. The provided SD card should be suitable, but if it is not please let me know.
