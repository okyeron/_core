The zeptocore is a small handheld device with some specs:

- mono or stereo playback of 16-bit (internal 32-bit) audio files @ 44.1 kHz sampling rate
- sd-card storage for audio + data
- recall up to 256 audio files (16 banks of 16 tracks)
- digital low-pass and high-pass filter
- basic single-cycle wavetable synthesizer
- realtime sequencer with optional quantization
- low-latency (<10 ms)

### goals

the goal of this project is to produce a device that achieves compelling music without learning, though learning is rewarded.

### non-goals

a non-goal for this project is to be emulate a specific musical device. 

a non-goal for this project is audio synthesis. though I may change my mind about this.
