Select a slice with **1-16** and then press another key on the **1-16** keypad to initiate a retrigger effect on the selected slice. The retrigger rate will be depending on the second key press, where **1** is the fastest rate and **16** is the slowest rate. 

If you want pitch up/down effects to applied to the retriggering then you can turn on the [Retrigger Setting](#retrigger-settings) under the effects (**A** + **15** in jump mode).
