There are two ways to change the tempo. You can either hold down the main button and turn the knob to change the tempo. The new tempo will flash briefly on screen. You can also tap in the tempo using the above combination. In both cases, the minimum allowable tempo is 30 BPM and the maximum allowable tempo is 300 BPM.
